REST Api application. This app uses Retrofit along with MVVM architecture to make a network call to a movie database called TheMovieDB. The App lets you search from within a vast library of movies and display them in the same activity. Then, once the user makes a selection and clicks on a movie a new fragment slides onto the screen with the movies details such as movie title, description, rating, etc ...

*** I will revisit this at some point and implement movie trailers as well.
